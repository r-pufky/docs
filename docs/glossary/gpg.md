# GPG/Encryption


## Signing Key

data sent by you has not been altered.


## Encryption Key
Key used to encrypt data. Data is typically signed with the [Signing
Key](#signing-key) after encryption.


## Authentication Key

to load your public GPG key and enable access to systems without needing any
information from you.
