Backup set Adoption
*******************
Previous backup sets from other machines may be adopted in place instead of
re-uploading all backup data. This applies for all crashplan installs.

#. Start container.
#. Sign in to your account.
#. Click the Replace Existing button to start the wizard.
#. **SKIP** File Transfer.
#. Once done with the wizard, go to your device's details and click Manage
   Files. You will probably see missing items in the file selection. This is
   normal, since path to your files may be different.
#. Update the file selection by re-adding your files. Do not unselect missing
   items yet.
#. Perform a backup. Because of de-duplication, files will not be uploaded
   again.
#. Once the backup is terminated, you can remove missing items if you don't
   care about file versions. Else, keep missing items.
