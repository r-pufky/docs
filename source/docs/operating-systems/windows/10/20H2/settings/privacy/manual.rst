Manual Setting Privacy Options
##############################
:cmdmenu:`âŒ˜ + r --> ms-settings:privacy`

**Strongly** recommend using :term:`GPO` and :term:`Registry` to apply settings
consistently. See other sections in :ref:`w10-20h2-settings-privacy`.

* Disable `all options on all 24 pages`_ and re-enable to taste.
* `Disable Ad Tracking`_.
* :cmdmenu:`Background Apps` Leave background service enable, but disable
  all apps. This will prevent searching from the start menu from breaking.

  .. note::
    If start menu searches start to fail, it is because background apps
    service has been disabled. See
    :ref:`wbase-specific-windows-fixes-background-apps`.

* :cmdmenu:`Camera` Leave enabled, but disable all apps.
* :cmdmenu:`Microphone` Leave enabled, but disable all apps. This will allow
  mumble to use the microphone. See `1803 update breaks microphone`_.
