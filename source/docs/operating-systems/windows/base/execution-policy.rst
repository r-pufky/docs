`Setting Execution Policy`_
###########################
Powershell scripts require unrestricted execution policy to be set to execute.
By default this is **disabled** and is the **correct choice**. Once you've
executed scripts, you **must** manually reset this to restricted or you leave
yourself open to bad things. This persists across sessions.

.. code-block:: powershell
  :caption: Check and set unrestricted policy (powershell as admin).

  Get-ExecutionPolicy
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Force

.. code-block:: powershell
  :caption: Set restricted policy (powershell as admin).

  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy restricted -force

Set Policy Via Script
*********************
Commands entered directly into powershell are executed. Scripts may be run
without setting execution policy by launching a sub-shell with ExecutionPolicy
bypassed.

.. code-block:: powershell
  :caption: Execute script without setting ExecutionPolicy.

  PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File {SCRIPT}.ps1
