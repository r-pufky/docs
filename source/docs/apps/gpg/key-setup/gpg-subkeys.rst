Generate Subkeys
################
Subkeys are issued from the master key and are used for specific actions *on
behalf of* the master identity. These subkeys are loaded onto Yubikeys for
everyday use. As they are subkeys, these can be revoked as needed or the master
key can be revoked/changed to invalidate all subkeys at once.

If the subkeys will not be stored on a self-destructing device when attacked
(e.g. a Yubikey), then **set an expiry date**.

  We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
  some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
  disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
  generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Verify Keys Are Secure
**********************
Highlight any potential concern areas with generated keys. These should appear
green with exceptions for the authentication subkey.

.. code-block:: bash

  gpg --export $KEYID | hokey lint

.. note::
  **Red** text indicates potential problems. Non-expiring keys will be marked as
  red; setting expiry is based on your security decisions.

  **Orange** text indicates warnings. This is typically seen as a missing
  embedded cross-certificate for the **authentication** subkey. The GPG
  authentication subkey does not sign and does not need to be cross-certified.

Verify GPG Password
*******************
There is no built in method to confirm a GPG password is correct. Verification
of passsword happens by checking the exit code and printing 'Correct' if the
command succeeded.

.. code-block:: bash
  :caption: Verify GPG password works.

  echo '1234' | gpg --batch --passphrase-fd 1 -o /dev/null --local-user $KEYID -as - && echo 'Correct.'
