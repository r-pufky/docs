Verify Geniue Yubikey
*********************
Ensure Yubikey is geniue and has not been tampered with during any step of the
supply chain.

#. https://www.yubico.com/genuine/
#. :cmdmenu:`Verify Device`
#. Touch Yubikey when prompted.

.. note::
  Yubico must be able to see the make and model of the device during the
  verification process.

``Verification Complete`` is displayed for genuine keys. Failure means potential
compromise and should be thrown out after it is confirmed to fail again.

Reset Yubikey
*************
This will `destroy any openpgp material`_ on the key and reset to the default
key state. Do this even if the Yubikey is new.

.. code-block:: bash
  :caption: Reset Yubikey openpgp.

  ykman openpgp reset

Alternatively using the `Yubikey Personalization Tool`_ will provide options to
do this via a GUI.

.. note::
  If the Yubikey is not brand new, ensure you are not deleting any other
  :term:`2FA` configurations.

.. code-block:: bash
  :caption: Show current Yubikey card shows with default values.

  gpg --card-status

* If not found, re-insert the key. There is a known race condition that may
  occur with older GPG libraries.
* Ensure latest firmware version using :term:`Yubikey Manager`.
* Ensure device has ``CCID`` mode enabled using :term:`Yubikey Manager`. Most
  firmware past ``3.1.8`` will have this permenantly enabled and not listed.

Configure Yubikey
*****************
Configure behavior of Yubikey so short touches will provide GPG material, while
long touches will provide Yubico OTP. This prevents accidental touches spewing
keystrokes into whatever is open. NFC is also disabled to force physical touch
to use key.

#. :cmdmenu:`Yubikey Manager --> Applications --> OTP`
#. Delete ``Slot 1``.
#. Configure ``Slot 2`` to use ``Yubico OTP``.

.. note::
  Newer keys can just use the :guilabel:`swap` button.
